# neopixel-fire
Attempting to make something that mildly resembles fire with neopixels.

The denser the pixels, the better this looks.  I've had the best luck with this: https://www.banggood.com/ESP32-C3-Development-Board-RISC-V-WiFi-Bluetooth-IoT-Development-Board-Compatible-with-Python-p-1914005.html?cur_warehouse=USA

Colors probably still need to be adjusted, but this is a good launching point!
